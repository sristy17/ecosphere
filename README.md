# EcoSphere — ESG Management Platform

An internal platform for tracking, gamifying, and reducing organizational carbon footprint. Employees log carbon-impact activities by department, join sustainability challenges to earn XP, and compete on a company-wide leaderboard.

## Problem Statement
Organizations struggle to make ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) tracking engaging for employees. EcoSphere turns carbon accountability into a gamified, department-level competition — combining real emissions data with challenge-based incentives.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React (Vite), React Router, Axios
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express 5
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Auth:** JWT + bcrypt

## Features
- User signup/login with JWT-based auth
- Department-level carbon transaction tracking
- Auto-calculated carbon summary per department
- Sustainability challenges with XP rewards
- Join/complete challenge flow
- Company-wide XP leaderboard
